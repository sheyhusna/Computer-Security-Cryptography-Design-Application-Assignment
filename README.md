# Computer-Security-Cryptography-Design-Application-Assignment
This project includes the design and implementation of custom stream and block ciphers with encryption/decryption demos, naming, workflow diagrams, and usage justification. It also proposes a hybrid cryptography application combining symmetric and asymmetric methods.

# Block Cipher
**EDES_zero** is a **fully commented**, **step-by-step educational implementation** of the **Data Encryption Standard (DES)** algorithm, written in C++.  
It demonstrates how DES operates internally, including key generation, expansion, substitution, and permutation processes.

## Compilation & Execution

To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ EDES_zero.cpp -std=c++17 -O2 -o EDES_zero

./EDES_zero
